# Codeforces Account Worth Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the Codeforces Account Worth Calculator, a fun and lighthearted project designed to estimate the "worth" of your Codeforces account based on various parameters such as rating, rank, number of contests participated in, and more.

## How it Works

The worth of your Codeforces account is calculated using a unique algorithm that takes into account multiple factors, including:

- Codeforces Rating
- Codeforces Rank
- Total Number of Contests Participated In
- Number of Questions Solved
- Number of Accepted Submissions
- Contribution to the Codeforces Community

The algorithm combines these factors to provide an entertaining and personalized estimate of the value of your Codeforces account.

## Usage
